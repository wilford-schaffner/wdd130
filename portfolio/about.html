                Hey! My name is Wilford Schaffner and I'm a UX/UI Designer
                living in Prosper, TX. My wife, my daughter and I love spending
                time together and going outside. I really love the opportunities
                technology brings into my life and how it helps me serve those I
                love the most. My interest in UX Design and Graphic Design
                actually started because of editing some videos and doing some
                small projects for my church, after that I really wanted to
                combine my passion for visual design and for serving others so I
                started my work in UX. I am very detail oriented so I really
                enjoy solving user pain points by honing in this skill. I love
                music, my family, and nature, and anything that can make any of
                those three things more enjoyable.

                  or beautifully made operating systems.

                    iOS 7 was a breathtakingly stunning and simple design. It
                    truly captivated me, and forever became my standard of a
                    good design. I loved the flat and simple nature of the icons
                    and graphics, juxtaposed with the glass-morphic elements of
                    the operating system and the immersive space backgrounds. It
                    was beautiful.

                  <p class="from-then-on">
                    From then on I would always pay very close attention to the
                    way things were designed, I then got heavily involved in
                    customizing my Android phone at the time. I loved
                    downloading custom icon-packs, then eventually even started
                    to create some of my own.

                    Years after I served a mission for my church (The Church of
                    Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints) and when COVID hit I
                    became a social media specialist. This sparked an intense
                    desire to have a career in design. When I came home from my
                    mission, I completed a UX Design Course through Google, and
                    now I am going to school to achieve a Bachelor’s Degree in
                    Web Design and Development. I’m stoked to see what the
                    future holds.
